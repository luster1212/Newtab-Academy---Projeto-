# Newtab-Academy---Projeto-
That is a project made by me for a course in Newtab Academy.
This website is a simple financial register, where you can add inputs and, at the final, see the results of your balance of payments.
The project was apply by a company called Via Varejo, in Brazil, in a test for TI or software engineers.
I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The JavaScript was apply only on mobile menu.

Feel free to ask anything.
